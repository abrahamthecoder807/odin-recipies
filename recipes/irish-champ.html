        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Irish champ is similar to a colcannon but is made by blending green onions or scallions with creamy meshed potatoes.
            It's great on its own, served steaming hot with extra butter on top, but it's also a perfect dish for a good quality
            sausages.
